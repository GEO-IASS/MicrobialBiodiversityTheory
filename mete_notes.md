THE BONE YARD:
about the forces governing microbial diversity or to test the predictions general biodiversity theory.

, microbial ecology has the potential to unify these observations under the predictions of general theory and hence, to anticipate microbial biodiversity within unexplored systems and rarely studied scales.

1) The study of microbial biodiversity has revealed ubiquitous patterns of commonness and rarity, generated predictions of taxonomic diversity up to global scales, and identified forces driving the structure and assembly of microbial communities (refs).
 
2) In addition, microbial ecologists have generated publically-accessible datasets that contain more taxonomic, functional, and metabolic diversity than all of ecology has generated over the last 100 years.

3) Despite the expanding catalog of microbial biodiversity, the same general patterns of commonness and rarity are often reported among disparate ecosystems and environments.

4) Among the most general, are the observations that most taxa in microbial communities are relatively rare (i.e., "rare biosphere"), that the abundance of dominant taxa scales from small samples to all of Earth, and that while few taxa are seemlingly ubiquitous, most are found in few locations (i.e., not everything is everywhere).

5) However, these patterns are poorly understood and rarely predicted. This F'n thing is Caaaa-rappy but gets us to where we need to go -- Will.

1) The greatest potential for understanding microbial biodiversity lies in the intersection of data, theory, and general relationships.

2) Data heavy studies with no theory, e.g., English Channel TS, Deep Sequencing reveals..., 

2-alt) Studies have shown rare taxa influence microbial community structure through deep sequencing or 

3) Theory heavy studies with little data: Curtis and Sloan 2002, 

4) Data heavy studies commenting a general pattern, 

5) Though focused on different systems, questions, and taxa, these studies are underpinned by an ecological relationship that is central to community ecology, biogeography, and biodiversity theory, i.e., the distribution of abundance among taxa.

5) These studies  attempt to characterize how abundance varies among taxa (i.e. the species aundance distribution (SAD)), the central pattern of biodiversity theory.

The Maximum Entropy Theory of Ecology has been touted as a unifying theory. 

However, it has yet to be tested on microorganisms
