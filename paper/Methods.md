## MaxEnt predictions of the SAD
### METE
**P1**  
**S1:** The maximum entropy theory of ecology (METE) (Harte et al. 2008, 2009, Harte 2011) is based on two empirical inputs: species richness (*S*) and total abundance (*N*).   
**S2:** These, along with an inferred rate of community-level metabolism (*E*), form the state variables of METE.  
**S3:** Four constraints are produced from these state variables.  
**S4:** These are the average number of individuals per species (*N*/*S*), the average per species metabolic flux (*E*/*S*), and the constraints that no species has more than *N* individuals or a greater total metabolic rate than *E*.  
**S5:** *E* is later integrated out of the SAD prediction.  

**P2**  
**S1:** The prediction of METE is based on a joint conditional probability distribution that describes the distribution of individuals (*n*) over species and of metabolism (*ε*) over individuals within a species (Harte et al. 2008, Harte 2011). 
**S2:** Entropy of the distribution is then maximized according to the method of Lagrangian multipliers (Jaynes 2003, Harte 2011).  
**S3:** The SAD is then derived by integrating out energy and dropping terms that are vanishingly small. This process then yields the log-series SAD (Fisher et al. 1943).  
**S4:** The log-series distribution is among the oldest and most successful SAD models but has generally lacked a convincing first-principle explanation from either an ecological or statistical perspective.  
**S4:** In this case, METE predicts the shape of which is dependent only on the values of *S* and *N*:

### Broken-stick 
While other MaxEnt models produce similar (Frank 2011) or identical (Pueyo et al. 2007, Dewar and Porté 2008) predictions for the form of the SAD, MaxEnt models based on different assumptions can yield different predictions (Haegeman and Etienne 2010).
