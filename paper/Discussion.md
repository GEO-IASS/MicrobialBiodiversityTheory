###P1: METE fails for microbes
**S1:** Maximum entropy theory of ecology (METE) has been highly successful in predicting how abundance varies within and across communities of macroscopic plants and animals.  
**S2:** Here, we showed that METE fails to explain similar degrees of variance within and among communities of bacteria, archaea, and microscopic fungi.  
**S3:** Likewise, the success of METE is influenced by its primary state variables (*N*, *S*) and by its primary constraint (*N*/*S*).  
**S4:** As a result, METE tends to fail with increasing *N* and *N*/*S*.  
**S5:** Consequently, these conditions also characterize numerical differences between microbial and macrobial SADs.  
**S6:** That is, *N* for microbial datasets often represents tens of thousands to millions of rRNA reads while *N* for macrobial SADs is often ranges between a few hundred to a few thousand individuals.  

###P2: METE fails as expected for large N
**S1:** The failure of the broken stick model and METE could have been anticipated.  
**S2:** It has been shown that as *N* increases, the evenness of the SAD can be expected to decrease as a result of purely numerical constraints (Locey and White 2013).  
**S3:** In the same way, as average abundance (*N*/*S*) increases, the evenness of the SAD can be expected to naturally decrease.  
**S4:** In both cases, constraints on the form of the SAD imposed by *N* and *N*/*S* lead to increasingly uneven SADs that outstrip the relatively even SADs predicted by the broken-stick and then eventually outstrip the otherwise highly uneven SADs predicted by METE (i.e. the log-series).  
**S5:**
