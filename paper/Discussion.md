###P1: METE fails for microbes
**S1:** Maximum entropy theory of ecology (METE) has been highly successful in predicting how abundance varies within communities of macroscopic plants and animals.  
**S2:** Here, we showed that METE generally fails to explain a high degrees of variance among microbes.
**S3:** Consistently 

###P2: METE fails as expected for large N


###P3:
