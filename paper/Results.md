**S1:** Across microbial datasets, SAD predictions from the maximum entropy theory of ecology (METE) generally failed to explain more than 60% of variation in abundance among species (Figure 1; Table 1).  
**S2:** Previous tests of METE on communities of macroscopic plants and animals produced much greater success (90% of variation or greater) (Harte et al. 2008, 2009, White et al. 2012).  
**S3:** As expected, due to the relatively even form of the geometric distribution, the broken-stick model performed considerably worse than METE and generally produced negative r-square values.   
**S4:** Negative values were possible because the relationship is not fitted, i.e., estimating variation around a line with a slope of 1.0 and intercept of zero.  
**S5:** While the log-series (METE) characterizes the form of the SAD better than the broken-stick, microbial SADs are still characterized by disparities in abundance that METE fails to capture.  
**S6:** Consequently, METE and the broken-stick frequently underpredict the abundance of the most abundant species and over predict the abundance of the rarest species.
