##P1
**S1:** Across microbial datasets, SAD predictions from the maximum entropy theory of ecology (METE) generally failed to explain more than 60% of variation in abundance among species and often produced negative r-squared values, which have no straigtforward interpretation (Figure 1; Table 1).  
**S2:** Previous tests of METE on communities of macroscopic plants and animals produced much greater success, often explaining 90% or greater variation in abundance (Harte et al. 2008, 2009, White et al. 2012, Xiao et al. 2014).  
**S3:** As expected, due to its relatively even form, the broken-stick model (effectively the geometric distribution) performed considerably worse than METE and generally produced negative r-square values.   
**S4:** Negative values were possible because the relationship is not fitted, i.e., estimating variation around a line with a slope of 1.0 and intercept of zero (White et al. 2012, Locey and White 2013, Xiao et al. 2014).  
**S5:** While the log-series (METE) characterizes the form of the SAD better than the broken-stick, microbial SADs are still characterized by disparities in abundance that METE fails to capture.  
**S6:** Both METE and the broken-stick under-predict the abundance of the most abundant species and over-predict the abundance of the rarest species.

##P2
**S1:** We found that the success of METE and the broken-stick were influenced by the two primary constraint-variables, i.e., total abundance *N* and species richness *S*. 

r2 vs. N:
HMP BS: R2 = -0.39, p = 0.0
HMP METE: R2 = -0.19, p = 0.0

r2 vs. S:
HMP BS: R2 = -0.39, p = 0.0
HMP METE: R2 = -0.19, p = 0.0
