# Introduction

##P1: Understanding patterns of commonness and rarity
**S1:** Understanding patterns of abundance, distribution, and diversity has been a central pursuit of ecology for over a century (Brown 1995).  
**S2:** Arguably, the most universal of these patterns is the uneven distribution of abundance among species (McGill et al. 2007).  
**S3:** In nearly all ecological communities, the species abundance distribution (SAD) reveals that few taxa are abundant while most are relatively rare.  
**S4:** Dozens of theories and thousands of studies have attempted to link this law-like pattern to the ecological processes that drive it.  
**S5:** However, successful theories that not only predict the SAD but couple it to other patterns of biodiveristy tend to be stochastic and primarily statistical (Hubbell 2001, McGill 2010, Harte 2011).

##P2: The success of constraint-based biodiversity theory
**S1:** The newest paradigm in predicting the SAD and to explaining its highly uneven form takes a constraint-based approach (Harte et al. 2003, Pueyo et al. 2006, Harte 2011, White et al. 2012, Locey and White 2013, Xiao et al. 2014).  
**S2:** Recognizing that the SAD is a distribution of a total abundance (*N*) among a number of species (*S*), constraint-based studies have sought to predict the most likely form of the SAD given only *N* and *S* as empirical inputs.  
**S3:** As this requires additional assumptions such as whether species and individuals are labeleld or unlabeled and whether average abundance (*N*/*S*) is also constrained, different constraint-based theories produce different predictions.  
**S4:** So far, the maximum entropy theory of ecology (METE) has been the most accurate constraint-based framework for predicting the SAD and linking it to other primary biodiversity patterns of biodiversity (Harte et al. 2003, Harte 2011, White et al. 2012, Xiao et al. 2014).


##P3: Constraint-based theory is rarely tested among microbes
**S1:** METE has been widely successful in predicting the SAD among communities of macroscopic plants and animals (White et al. 2012).  
**S2:** METE then places the pattern at the center of a unifying maximum-likelihood framework that predicts up to **7?** other geographical, abundance-, energy-, and richness-related patterns.  
**S3:** While this unifying breadth is unmatched among biodiversity theories, refinements are needed to improve the accuracy of METE's energy-related predictions (Xiao et al. 2014).  
**S4:** However, in terms of predicting the SAD, METE often explains more than 90% of variation in abundance among species of plant and animal, based on the largest available compilations of community data (White et al. 2012).  
**S5:** Yet, despite its success in predicting SADs and potential to unify other patterns, METE has yet been tested among the most abundant and taxonomically diverse organisms on Earth, i.e., bacteria.
