# Introduction

##P1: Understanding patterns of commonness and rarity

**S1:** Understanding patterns of abundance, distribution, and diversity has been a central pursuit of ecology for over a century (Brown 1995).  
**S2:** Arguably, the most universal of these ecological patterns is the uneven distribution of abundance among species (McGill et al. 2007).  

**S3:** In nearly all documented ecological communities, the species abundance distribution (SAD) reveals that few taxa are abundant, the remaining being relatively rare.  

**S4:** Since the ubiquity of this distribution was first realized, it has been a major focus of macroecology to link its law-like repetition to the ecological processes that drive it.
 
**S5:** However, successful theories that predict the SAD and couple it to other patterns of biodiveristy are primarily stochastic and statistical in nature (Hubbell 2001, McGill 2010, Harte 2011).


##P2: The success of constraint-based biodiversity theory
**S1:** The newest paradigm in predicting the SAD takes a purely constraint-based approach (Harte et al. 2008, 2009, Harte 2011, Pueyo et al. 2006, White et al. 2012, Locey and White 2013, Xiao et al. 2014).  

**S2:** Recognizing that the SAD is a distribution of total abundance (*N*) among a number of species (*S*), constraint-based methods seek to predict the most likely form of the SAD given summation of the system (e.g., *N* and *S*)  as the only empirical inputs.  


**Alt S3:**
Most of these apparoaches are based on a maximum-likelihood framwork that invokes the principle of maximum entropy, wherein the most likely form of the SAD is that having the most ways of occurring given a set of constraints (i.e. *N* and *S*)

**S4:** Though simple in concept, MaxEnt predictions require assumptions such as whether species and/or individuals are distinguishable, and whether average abundance (*N*/*S*) is constrained (Pueyo et al. 2006, Harte 2011).  

**S5:** Consequently, different predictions for abundance patterns (like the SAD) are possible under a constraint-based framework (Haegeman and Etienne 2010).  

**S6:** So far, the maximum entropy theory of ecology (METE) has been the most accurate constraint-based framework for predicting the SAD and linking it to other primary patterns of biodiversity (Harte et al. 2008, 2009, Harte 2011, White et al. 2012, Xiao et al. 2014).


##P3: Constraint-based theory is rarely tested among microbes
**S1:** METE has been widely successful in predicting the SAD among communities of macroscopic organisms (White et al. 2012).  
 
**S2**
METE's success has lead to the pattern being placed at the center of a unified maximum likelihood framework that predicts various geographical, abundance-, energy-, and richness-related patterns. 

**S3:** 

While METE's predictive power is unmatched among biodiversity theories, refinements are needed to improve the accuracy of METE's energy-related predictions (Xiao et al. 2014).  


**S4:** However, in terms of predicting the SAD, METE often explains more than 90% of variation in abundance among species of plant and animal, based on the largest available compilations of community count data (White et al. 2012).  

**S5:** Yet, despite its success in predicting SADs and potential to unify various biological patterns, METE has yet been tested among the most abundant and taxonomically diverse organisms on Earth, i.e., bacteria and archaea.

##P4: Patterns of microbial commonness and rarity are poorly characterized

**S1:** Across microbial communities of natural and host-associated ecosystems, most microbial taxa account for the minority of relative abundance.
**S2:** This seemingly universal pattern of microbial commonness and rarity is known as the microbial "rare biosphere".  
**S3:** The rare biosphere has been documented in numerous studies since its first description less than a decade ago (Sogin et al. 2006).  
**S4:** Though often described (e.g., as a percent of species with less than 0.1% abundance),  the rare biosphere pattern is rarely examined with general biodiversity theory.  
**S5:** Yet, the rare biosphere pattern appears to reiterate the universal nature of uneven SADs, the most powerful predictions of which are arguably produced by METE.  

##P5: Here, we...
**S1:** Here, we test the SAD prediction of METE using the largest compilation of microbial community data ever assembled using publicly available sources.  
**S2:** These data include 20,216 sites of bacterial and archaeal communities from the Earth Microbiome Project, the Human Microbiome Project, and community datasets from Argonne National Laboratory's metagenomic server MG-RAST.  
**S3:** We use the maximum-likelihood prediction for the Broken Stick model as an additional MaxEnt prediction for the SAD based on *N* and *S* (Haegeman and Etienne 2010).
**S4:** We compare these MaxEnt predictions to microbial SADs as previously done in studies of macroscopic plants and animals (e.g., White et al. 2012, Xiao et al. 2014).  
**S5:** In demonstrating previously undocumented failure of METE to predict microbial SADs, we suggest a more appropriate MaxEnt model for SADs characterized by a "rare biosphere", i.e., a MaxEnt form of the Zipf-distribution.
